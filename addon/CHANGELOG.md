## 1.0.16
- **Fix ZHA group entities counted as area lights**: ZHA group entities (e.g., `Circadian_Kitchen_Standard_color`) were inheriting the coordinator device's area instead of using the entity registry's area override (`Circadian_Zigbee_Groups`). This caused the coordinator area (Office) to report 20 ZHA lights instead of 4, adding the coordinator's IEEE to area groups. Periodic updates to those groups sent conflicting commands to other areas' devices, causing breathing/oscillation.

## 1.0.14
- **Fix override decay after midnight**: Brightness and color overrides (from step_up/down, Full Send, GloDown) no longer decay instantly after midnight — `set_at` time is now correctly converted to h48 space before computing decay

## 1.0.11
- **Fix breathing on non-Standard filter lights**: Lights with Overhead/Lamp/etc. filters now use individual commands instead of ZHA group broadcasts, preventing stale group ID cross-talk
- **Fix ZHA group cleanup**: Remove members before deleting obsolete groups; smart color_temp_kelvin clamping using actual light attributes
- **Fix shed/switch-only area visibility**: Areas configured in glozones now appear even without light entities
- **Apply brightness_override on all turn-on paths**: `circadian_on`, `lights_on`, and `lights_toggle_multiple` now apply decayed brightness_override immediately
- **Fix cooldown countdown**: Timer display now works correctly; areas with only switch entities show properly
- **Add configurable motion sensor cooldown**: New setting for motion sensor cooldown duration
- **Fix motion/contact sensor config persistence**: Config now persists after save
