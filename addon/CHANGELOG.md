## 5.0.0-alpha
**Major Release - Ascend/Descend Lighting Model**

**BREAKING CHANGE**: Complete redesign of the adaptive lighting model. Existing configurations will be reset.

**New Features:**
- **Ascend/Descend Model**: Replaced rise/fall terminology with clearer ascend/descend phases
  - Ascend phase: Light brightness and color temperature rise (morning)
  - Descend phase: Light brightness and color temperature fall (evening)
- **Activity Presets**: Pre-configured timing patterns for different lifestyles
  - Young Child, Adult, Night Owl, Dusk Bat, Early Shift Worker, Late Shift Worker
- **Solar Color Rules**: New rules for automatic color temperature adjustments
  - "Warm at night" rule: Force warmer colors around sunset and before sunrise
  - "Cool during day" rule: Push colors cooler during bright daylight hours
  - Configurable fade transitions between modes
- **Cursor Controls**: Independent brightness and color adjustments
  - Step Up/Down: Adjust both brightness and color midpoints
  - Bright Up/Down: Adjust only brightness midpoint
  - Color Up/Down: Adjust only color midpoint
  - Reset: Return to base wake/bed time positions
- **48-Hour Unwrapping**: Cross-midnight schedule handling for shift workers and night owls
- **Speed-to-Slope Mapping**: New 1-10 speed scale for intuitive curve steepness control

**UI Changes:**
- Rebuilt Light Designer with Ascend/Descend panels
- Activity preset selector for quick configuration
- Date slider for previewing seasonal variations
- Solar color rules configuration
- New x-axis labels: "ascend starts", "wake", "descend starts", "bed"

**Technical Changes:**

- Speed parameters use 1-10 scale mapped to logistic slopes
- Separate runtime midpoints for brightness and color (not persisted)
- New API endpoints: `/api/presets`, `/api/sun_times`
- Updated webserver configuration defaults

**Migration:**
- Old configurations will be ignored; users start fresh with new model
- Legacy designer preserved as `designer_legacy.html` for reference

## 4.2.024-alpha
**Enhancement - Hue Room Group Targeting**

**Improvements:**
- Detect and register Hue grouped-light resources alongside existing Magic_ ZHA groups, capturing area metadata for each entity.
- Prefer Hue room entities when issuing `light.turn_on` calls or checking area state, falling back to ZHA groups or area coverage when required.
- Preserve legacy aliases and logging so previously managed mappings and test hooks continue to function.

**Testing:**
- `pytest addon/tests/unit/test_main_websocket.py::TestHomeAssistantWebSocketClientAsync::test_determine_light_target_hue_group`
- `pytest addon/tests/unit/test_main_websocket.py::TestHomeAssistantWebSocketClient::test_update_zha_group_mapping_magic_prefix`

## 4.2.023-alpha
**Enhancement - Blueprint Sync Refresh**

**Improvements:**
- Track SHA-256 checksums for bundled blueprint YAML files and refresh deployments whenever content changes, ensuring Home Assistant picks up updates even when filenames stay the same.

**Testing:**
- Not run (not requested).

## 4.2.022-alpha
**Fix - Hue Dimmer Blueprint Detection**

**Improvements:**
- Allow the bundled Hue dimmer blueprint to match devices whose model string is reported as plain `Hue dimmer switch`, ensuring switches paired via the official Hue integration are eligible while keeping existing RWL021/RWL022 entries.

## 4.2.017-alpha
**Enhancement - Blueprint Disable Cleanup**

**Improvements:**
- Added double-press OFF handling to the bundled Hue dimmer blueprint, routing the action to `magiclight.magiclight_off` for a fast shutoff.
- When `manage_blueprints` is disabled the add-on now removes previously deployed MagicLight blueprints and purges managed automations on startup, keeping Home Assistant free of stale artifacts.

**Testing:**
- `pytest addon/tests/unit/test_blueprint_manager.py addon/tests/unit/test_integration_manager.py`

## 4.2.016-alpha
**Feature - Magic Mode State Persistence**

**Improvements:**
- Persist magic mode areas, time offsets, and brightness offsets in `magic_mode_state.json` so active rooms and their positioning survive restarts.
- Load saved state during startup and resave automatically whenever offsets change, including solar-midnight resets and manual dimming adjustments.
- Solar-midnight maintenance now clears stored brightness offsets alongside time offsets to avoid stale dimming.
- Step up/down primitives now re-query adaptive lighting after adjusting the time offset so any stored brightness adjustments are applied consistently.

## 4.2.014-alpha
**Enhancement - Brightness Offset Handling**

**Improvements:**
- Reworked `dim_up`/`dim_down` to store brightness offsets as percentages of the active curve span, matching the Light Designer model.
- Allow offsets to push all the way to configured brightness limits, removing the previous ±50% clamp while still respecting area min/max bounds.
- Apply the same percentage offset when fetching adaptive lighting so live updates reflect the stored adjustments immediately.

**Testing:**
- `pytest addon/tests/unit/test_primitives.py`

## 4.2.013-alpha
**Enhancement - Designer Color Output Controls**

**Improvements:**
- Added a Color Output selector to the Light Designer UI, letting users choose Kelvin, RGB, or XY directly from the interface.
- Startup now reads the chosen color mode from `designer_config.json`, keeping the runtime and designer in sync without relying on supervisor options.

**Documentation:**
- Updated README and docs to point users at the Designer for color behaviour and clarify remaining add-on options.

**Notes:**
- The legacy `color_mode` add-on option has been removed; saving settings from the Designer migrates existing installs automatically.

## 4.2.012-alpha
**Maintenance - Alpha Tag & Hotfix**

**Enhancements:**
- Added `manage_blueprints` option so the add-on can automatically create Hue dimmer switch automations for every lit area.
- Integration downloads now derive from `repository.yaml`; removed the legacy `integration_repo` option.

**Documentation:**

**Notes:**
- Carries forward the blueprint deployment enhancements introduced in 4.2.007 while we stabilize the release.

## 4.2.007

## 4.2.0
**Feature - Automatic Integration Management**

**Improvements:**
- Add-on now deploys the `magiclight` custom integration on startup by default, installing updates automatically and removing the managed copy when the toggle is disabled.
- Added `manage_integration` option to let advanced users opt out of automatic deployment while still providing a clean uninstall path.
- Added `integration_repo` option (branch via optional `owner/repo#branch` format) so release vs. staging sources can be switched without rebuilding the add-on. *(Removed in 4.2.007-alpha; the add-on now infers the repository from `repository.yaml`.)*
- Relocated the local build helper to the repository root to package both add-on and integration assets from a single entry point.
- Added dedicated `dim_up`/`dim_down` primitives for smoother curve-based dimming without relying on switch automations.
